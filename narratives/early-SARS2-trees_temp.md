Determining the "root" (or most-recent-common-ancestor, MRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 is important for understanding its emergence and early evolution.


SARS-CoV-2 derives from bat SARS-like coronaviruses, so one approach assumes the root of the tree is the SARS-CoV-2 sequence most closely related to bat coronaviruses, as subsequent evolution in humans would make SARS-CoV-2 more different from these relatives.
This is _outgroup_-based rooting.


The tree at right shows early SARS-CoV-2 sequences with the root at a cluster of viruses among the most similar to the bat coronavirus relatives.
The mutations on branches leading away from this root (eg, T29095C, C28144T, T8782C) all make SARS-CoV-2 more different its bat coronavirus relatives, since those relatives have T at site 29095, C at 28144, and T at site 8782.


The tree at right is colored according to how many mutations each sequence has relative to the inferred ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 (recombinant common ancestor, recCA).
As you move away from the root of the tree (to the left), descendant sequences have more mutations relative to the recCA, as expected as the virus evolves aways from its bat coronavirus relatives.


So if we just think about how much each sequence differs from bat SARS-like coronaviruses (ie, _outgroup_ rooting), the tree at right makes sense.
But...
