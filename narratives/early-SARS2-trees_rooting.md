Determining the "root" (or most-recent-common-ancestor, MRCA) of SARS-CoV-2 is important for understanding its emergence and early evolution.


SARS-CoV-2 derives from bat SARS-like coronaviruses, so the root of the tree should be the SARS-CoV-2 sequence most similar to bat coronaviruses, as subsequent evolution in humans would make SARS-CoV-2 more different from these relatives.
This is _outgroup_-based rooting.


The tree at right shows early SARS-CoV-2 sequences with the root at a cluster of viruses among the most similar to the bat coronavirus relatives.
The mutations on branches leading away from this root (eg, T29095C, C28144T, T8782C) all make SARS-CoV-2 more different its bat coronavirus relatives (eg, those relatives have T at site 29095, C at 28144, and T at site 8782).


The tree at right is colored according to how many mutations each sequence has relative to the inferred bat ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 (recombinant common ancestor, recCA).
As you move away from the root of the tree (to the right), descendants have more mutations relative to the recCA, as expected as the virus evolves aways from its bat coronavirus relatives.


So if we just think about how similar each sequence is to bat SARS-like coronaviruses (ie, _outgroup_ rooting), the tree at right makes sense.
But...

# [But the sequences most similar to bat coronaviruses are not the first ones collected](https://nextstrain.org/community/sars2phylo/early-SARS2-trees/crits-christoph2024-Feb-15-2020-lineage-A-C29095T-colordates)

We might also expect the first SARS-CoV-2 sequences collected from humans to be at the root of the tree.
This idea is _date_-based rooting.

But when we color the tree by the date on which sequences were collected as shown at right, we see that the first-collected sequences aren't at the root when the tree is rooted on the sequences most similar to bat coronaviruses!


Instead, the first collected sequences are mostly in cluster that has three additional mutations away from bat coronaviruses (T29095C, C28144T, and T8782C) relative to the root of the tree (you can see this more clearly by mousing over the blue box for December 2019 at the color key in the upper left).

# [But if we root on first collected sequences, then sequences most similar to bat coronaviruses are descendants](https://nextstrain.org/community/sars2phylo/early-SARS2-trees/crits-christoph2024-Feb-15-2020-lineage-B-colormuts)

We can instead use _date_-based rooting to place the root of the tree on the first collected sequences, as shown at right.

But then if we color the tree by how many mutations separate each SARS-CoV-2 sequence from the inferred bat coronavirus ancestor (recCA) as shown at right, the sequences closest to the bat coronavirus ancestor are not near the root of the tree.
This rooting requires that the early evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in humans involved multiple mutations (eg, C8782T, T28144C, and C29095T) that all happened to make SARS-CoV-2 more similar to its bat coronavirus relatives.

# [Outgroup- and date-based rooting are inconsistent](https://nextstrain.org/community/sars2phylo/early-SARS2-trees/crits-christoph2024-Feb-15-2020-lineage-B-colormuts?l=scatter&scatterX=date&scatterY=mutations_from_recCA)

Another way to look at the data is to simply make a scatter plot of the date on which each sequence was collected versus how many mutations it has relative to the bat coronavirus relative recCA, as shown at right.

This plot clearly shows how the first human sequences collected are _not_ the most similar to the bat coronavirus relatives.
In other words, the dots representing the first collected sequences (the ones furthest to the left) are _not_ the sequences most similar to the bat coronavirus ancestor (the ones furthest towards the bottom).

This discrepancy between outgroup- and date-based rooting was first analyzed in detail in a paper by [Pipes et al (2020)](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/4/1537/6028993) who concluded:

_"These results suggest that phylogenetic evidence alone is unlikely to identify the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we caution against strong inferences regarding the early spread of the virus based solely on such evidence."_
