## Displaying the interactive narrative and trees via `auspice`
The final trees are saved in [./auspice/](auspice) where they can be displayed as Nextstrain community builds using the [instructions here](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/guides/share/community-builds.html).
Specifically, go to [https://nextstrain.org/community/sars2phylo/early-SARS2-trees](https://nextstrain.org/community/sars2phylo/early-SARS2-trees) to see the trees.
